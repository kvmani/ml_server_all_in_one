# Super Resolution Help

## Quick start

1. Drop a PNG, JPG, or WEBP image into the workspace.
2. Pick the scale (2x or 4x) and the Real-ESRGAN model.
3. Choose the output format (PNG or JPG).
4. Run the upscale and use the slider to compare the result.
5. Optional: click **Use sample image** if you want to preview the workflow without uploading your own file.

## Tips

- PNG keeps the sharpest details; JPG reduces file size.
- GPU acceleration is automatic when available.
- All processing is in memory; refresh the page to clear the session.
