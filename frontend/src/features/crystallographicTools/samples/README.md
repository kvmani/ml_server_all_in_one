Bundled CIF samples
===================

Place additional `.cif` files in this folder to surface them in the Crystal Viewer library picker. Files are bundled offline via Vite’s `import.meta.glob` and displayed with a derived name (filename) and formula (if `_chemical_formula_sum` is present). No network access is used; everything ships with the repo.
